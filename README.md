# Transposition-Cipher-Web-Application
This is a web application that encrypts messages using the Transposition Cipher method. 

A transposition cipher is one of many encryption methods that is dependent on each characters position of the plain-text message. The cipher follows a specific algorithm to encrypt the message. First, the algorithm removes all spaces of the message. Then, each letter are put into rows with a specific column count. Finally, the algorithm reads the characters from top to bottom one column at a time from left to right. 

To see this algorithm in action, simply execute my PHP code and input your plain-text message.
